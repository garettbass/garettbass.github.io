            Rec Room Studio is an extension to the Unity Editor that enables
            advanced creators to build some very sophisticated content for Rec
            Room, including importing assets purchased from the Unity Asset
            Store.  Third party assets invariably include shaders that will not
            be present in the Rec Room game client, and manually creating
            materials that were compatible with shaders in the Rec Room game
            client was tedious and error prone.
            Fortunately, the process is pretty easy to automate, and this tool
            I created generally makes all of the right choices for you, but
            still allows you override its mapping from third party material
            properties to Rec Room material properties.
        <br><br>
            The left column lists all of the materials found in the creators
            content that are currently unsupported by the Rec Room game client.
            When a creator imports some new assets, this Material Conversion
            window will appear to assist them in making the conversions
            immediately, otherwise it will appear when a creator tries to upload
            unsupported content to the game.  Expanding any of the items in the
            left column will list all of the specific models using that
            material, which can be helpful to identify a more representative
            model to preview the conversion.
        <br><br>
            The top section of the right column lists all of the material
            properties from the unsupported material, and allows creators to
            choose which property of a Rec Room compatible material is a good
            match for that property.  Some automatic matching is done by
            a sequence of simple keyword heuristics, e.g mapping a property
            named "Color" to the "Albedo" input of a Rec Room material.
            The live preview at the bottom of the right column shows you what
            you're getting before you commit to it.

            I implemented the shader for the glass prop in Rec Room, which
            includes a few designer-configurable properties with some commentary
            on their effect, such as:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Alpha Influence On Albedo</b> - The color of a transparent
                surface is reduced by transparency as more of the incident light
                passes through the surface instead of reflecting back to the
                observer.</li>
                <li><b>Fresnel Influence On Specular</b> - A transparent surface
                is less reflective when viewed head on, as more light passes
                through the surface.</li>
                <li><b>Fresnel Influence On Alpha</b> - A transparent surface is
                more reflective at a grazing angle, as less light passes
                through the surface and more is reflected.</li>
                <li><b>Refraction Index</b> - Configurable
                refraction index.  Glass is usually around 1.5, but in Rec Room
                we default to 2.0.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="page-content">
            The shader uses the Fresnel term (evaluated via Schlick or Unity's
            approximation, configurable per platform) to vary the alpha and
            specular terms, where alpha corresponds to transmission, and
            specular corresponds to reflection sampled from an environment map
            or light probe.  Nothing particularly fancy here, but some basic
            research made this look much more like glass than the basic Unity
            transparent shader.

            An Animation Timeline asset can be used anywhere a normal animation
            asset is required.
            Other animation assets can be dropped onto the timeline,
            and adjusted for blending at runtime.
            Non-additive animations can be converted to additive animations by
            providing a base pose animation.
            In this example, two animations that normally target the male
            character skeleton, have been retargeted to drive Lou's female
            character skeleton.

            The UI also has animation event tracks, used here
            to trigger a particle system spawning stars from the "Confetti_P" event.
            The whole multi-track UI is rendered by a single Slate widget that
            implements a very basic, but capable, IMGUI API (not Dear IMGUI).
            Typical Unreal Engine editor UI is a tree of Slate Widgets, each
            mirroring the underlying state and subscribing to change events in
            order to stay in sync.  Using that approach here could have been
            very time consuming, requring many widgets and carefully synchronizing
            the tree of widgets with the underlying data structures.
            <br><br>
            The advantages of an IMGUI approach were twofold.  First, a dynamic
            UI can be rendered by traversing the underlying data
            structures representing the collection of animations, their start
            times, durations, and blend in/out times, and producing a relevant
            UI element for each editable aspect, drawing the draggable time
            ranges of each animiation track, draggable blend in/out markers,
            and the draggable playback needle.  This doesn't require any
            explicit synchronzation, and the UI elements always directly
            represent the underlying state.<br><br>Second, Unreal's Live C++
            support makes it trivial to recompile and reload the functions that
            call the IMGUI API without having to restart the editor or the game
            client.  This makes iterating on the features of the UI very quick,
            since I can try something out and see the results within seconds.

            I used the same IMGUI Slate widget to create this debug menu for
            the game, which enabled the design and QA teams to quickly select
            a variety of gameplay state in order to start the gameplay with
            specific progression, character stats, equipemtn, and specific
            quest outcomes.  Here the mouse cursor is being directed by a
            game controller, because this UI also needed to be easily accessible
            on a console for QA.

            The video above shows the Unity editor experience for debugging
            behavior trees while the game is running.
            Users can select an AI agent to debug either from the list on the

            character in the game view.
            The behavior tree is rendered showing the green path to the
            chosen leaf behavior.  By stepping the simulation, the user can

            Building vast collections of game content, such as inventory items,
            spells, and other special abilities, often benefit from tabular
            data entry.  Excel and Google spreadsheets can offer a lot of
            utility in this regard, and are often used, but can have some serious
            drawbacks.  Spreadsheets often have very limited game-specific context,
            unless it has been generated or manually entered, and they can be very
            challenging to diff and merge.
            <br><br>
            This UI was very easy to render with high performance using Unity's
            lowest level IMGUI APIs with very limited indirection.
            Each row of the spreadsheet is represented by a separate asset file,
            which makes diffing and merging very easy, and reduces the likelyhood of
            conflicts between different designers, since they are often working
            on different sections of the same content set.  Each cell of the
            spreadsheet has all of the game-specific context available in the
            editor, which makes it easy to select correct enum values, reference
            assets of a specific type, or create new assets with well defined
            default values.  It also benefits from specialized UI only availble
            in the editor, such as the localization string selection popup.
            <br><br>
            This tabular data can still be exported to Excel in order to create
            some useful data visualizations like graphs and charts, or to assign
            vast swaths of values via formulas, and later imported from Excel
            to apply changes only to the modified cells.

            I implemented a web-based Lua debugger that is hosted by the game client, so
            that our gameplay team could connect to a debug build of the game on a mobile
            device and debug their code as it ran on the device.  For those who
            may recognize it, the appearance of the debugger is very heavily
            inspired by the Xcode interface at the time 🤓.
